                <p>At Mackinaw Llewellins, we pride ourselves on maintaining a long ancestrial line of superb hunting traits, honed from the founding sires generations ago. We take breeding seriously, and are extremely selective in whom we agree to sell our dogs.</p>

                <h4>Owner Requirements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Owner of an ML must train and hunt with the dog.</strong> These dogs were bred to be active hunters, not idle couch potatos. </li>
                    <li><strong>Must treat their dog like family.</strong> These are not ordinary dogs, and their personalities are better suited toward companionship than isolation. Therefore, they must be allowed to live inside and have proper care, nutrition, love and attention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay in contact with us.</strong> We have a special bond with each and every dog that comes through our door. To ensure our dogs are receiving the best treatment possible, we ask that you keep in touch with us -- sharing any hunting victories, successful hunt tests, or just the special bond you have with your Mackinaw Llew.</li>
                </ul>
